I attended a Data Visualization Bootcamp hosted by [DPHi](https://dphi.tech/lms/learn/data-analysis-and-visualization-101/914).This was an eye opening and mind boggling experience. Being an AI changemaker in the community, learning how to create interactive dashboards in Python is motivating.

Plotly is one of the finest data visualization tools available built on top of visualization library D3.js, HTML and CSS. It is created using Python and the Django framework.  One can choose to create interactive data visualizations online or use the libraries that plotly offers to create these visualizations in the language/ tool of choice. It is compatible with a number of languages/ tools: R, Python, MATLAB, Perl, Julia, Arduino.

## Steps for creating plots in Plotly.
Data visualization is an art with no hard and fast rules. One should simply do what it takes to convey the message to the audience. What are the steps for creating interactive plots using plotly?

      * Get the data & preprocess it to convert it into the desired format.
      * Call the plotly API in the language/ tool of your choice.
      * Create the plot by specifying objectives like the data that is to be represented at each axis of the plot, most appropriate plot type (like histogram, boxplots, 3D surfaces), color of data points or line in the plot and other features.
